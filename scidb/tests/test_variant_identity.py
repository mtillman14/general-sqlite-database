"""Tests for the display-side variant discriminator (``variant_identity_batch``).

Two records can sit at the same ``(type, schema_id)`` and be distinguishable
only by the *body* of the function that produced them. The supersession keys
used by ``load`` and node state deliberately call those two records the same
variant (newest wins). The display layers cannot — they show both at once, so
they need a name for each. That is what these tests pin down.

See ``docs/claude/function-version-variants.md``.
